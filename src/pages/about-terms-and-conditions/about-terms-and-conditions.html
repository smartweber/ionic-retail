                Specifically, pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, we may be required to file an informational return with
                the IRS reporting Transactions and third-party network transactions with legal entities or persons that occur
                in a given calendar year. If you use ReelTrail Payment Services, you acknowledge that ReelTrail/ReelTrail
                Payment processor(s) will report the total amount of payments you receive each calendar year as required
                by the Internal Revenue Service.</li>

              <li>For U.S. Sellers, Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) regulations require that U.S. third-party settlement organizations
                and payment processors, file Form 1099- K to report unadjusted annual gross sales information for sellers
                that meet both of the following thresholds in a calendar year (reporting):
                <ol type="1">
                  <li>More than $20,000 in gross sales, and</li>

              </li>
            </ol>

          </ol>

          As a result of these regulations, Sellers who approach one hundred and seventy-five (175) transactions in a calendar year,
          regardless of sales volume and aggregated across his or her ReelTrail selling account, will be required by ReelTrail
          to provide taxpayer- identification information and will be notified via email and through other communication
          channels available on the Site.

            <h4>
              <i>Deposits</i>
            </h4>
          </li>
          All funds resulting from a completed Payment Transaction will be disbursed in Seller’s checking account and or Venmo account
          through Marketplace Services. Payment Transactions are considered complete once the payment is approved by ReelTrail’s
          payment processor(s). If a Seller’s first sale date is less than ninety (90) days from the day the Seller registers
          for Marketplace Services, Payment Transaction completion also requires that the sold item is marked as “shipped”
          using the tools made available in Seller’s Marketplace Services. Any refunds, adjustments, or other amounts paid
          to buyers in connection with purchases, or for funds received since the last Payment transaction Date, as defined
          in Section 4b, are also applied to Seller’s Checkout Services balance. Funds in a Marketplace Services are deposited
          immediately after payment transaction into Seller’s Bank Checking Account at the end of each transaction.

          <ol type="a">
            <li>Upon Seller’s election of payment by credit card or debit card ReelTrail’s payment processor(s) will initiate
              the payment transaction and disbursing the net amount into Seller’s Bank Checking Account after each payment
              transaction. Each Payment transaction disbursement will fall on standard Sunday through Sunday with the possible
              exclusion of US national and/or bank holidays.

              <li>If we reasonably conclude, based on information available to us, that a Seller’s actions and/or performance
                in connection with Marketplace Services may result in buyer disputes, chargebacks, or other claims, then
                the ReelTrail and its payment processor(s) may, in its sole discretion, put into effect a hold, deposit delay,
                or reserve associated with Seller’s Checking Account. A hold may be put on funds associated with a particular
                Payment Transaction in the event of disputes or investigations associated with the order for the shorter
                of:

                <ol type="i">
                  <li>180 days after the estimated delivery date; or</li>

                  <li>completion of any investigation(s) regarding any Sellers actions and/or performance in connection with
                    the Payment Transaction. Deposit delays are defined as the number of days between a sale and the day
                    the net amount from the sale becomes available for deposit, provided the payment has been completed as
                    described in Section 4a. A deposit delay may be between 0 and 180 days. A deposit delay is applied across
                    all Payment Transactions for Seller. A reserve is defined as a fixed percentage of Seller’s checking
                    account and or credit card balance being frozen by Reeltrail’s payment processor. All holds, deposit
                    delays, and reserves will be communicated to Seller by ReelTrail’s payment processor(s) and will email
                    Seller or some other type of notification through the ReelTrail Site. ReelTrail and its payment processor(s)
                    will not be liable to a Seller if they act in accordance with the provisions of this Section [4].</li>

                  <li>In the event funds designated for cash payment cannot be deposited into Seller’s Bank Checking Account,
                    the funds will be deposited into the Venmo Account. Seller will be required to update his or her Bank
                    Checking Account information and such funds will automatically be transferred to Seller’s new Bank Checking
                    Account within 7 business days.</li>
