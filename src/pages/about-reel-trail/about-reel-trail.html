        Keep it Simple
      </ion-card-title>
      <p>
        ReelTrail is a simple online marketplace for sportsmen/women and outdoor enthusiasts to buy, sell and learn about outdoor gear, whether it's new, used, or vintage. We also wanted to make booking crazy-fun trips a part of the experience.

        People over Profits
      </ion-card-title>
      <p>
        Relationships are the gold standard for us. We want to help others create small or large businesses through our platform. We know how it is when the big companies are over-charging, adding in hidden fees, and taking advantage of their users. Here at ReelTrail, we like to be transparent and simple. Oh, and inexpensive.

        Our Story
      </ion-card-title>
      <p>
        ReelTrail was derived from a small storefront located in Charleston, South Carolina, where we sold outdoor gear through consignment. Dealing with sites like eBay and Craigslist were a huge pain, and the fees never ended. We needed a market tailored for outdoorsmen/women. So we put our noggins together and decided how we could get a simple solution in everyone's hands.

      <h5>Love the outdoors? So do we!</h5>
      <br>
      <p>
        <span style="font-kerning:none;">ReelTrail is a community for outdoor enthusiasts to buy and sell outdoor gear. We believe in conservation and environmental
          awareness, so donating annually to trusted non-profits is a part of our mission. We hope to help recycle gear and
          keep it in circulation whether it's collecting dust or is sitting on idle in your closet, garage, trunk, etc. ReelTrail's
          platform is designed with low fees, and to keep all fellow outdoor enthusiasts protected from over-paying when
          reselling gear.

          sold outdoor gear through consignment. Dealing with sites like eBay and Craigslist were a huge pain, and the fees never ended.</span>
        <span style="font-kerning:none;"> ReelTrail launched in 2017 in response to the frustration they experienced while trying to buy and sell outdoor gear
          on other online platforms. Kirk and Ryan knew there was a need for a market tailored to outdoorsmen/women. The
          solution then arose: An online community created and run by outdoor enthusiasts where buying and selling outdoor
          gear is simple and affordable.</span>
